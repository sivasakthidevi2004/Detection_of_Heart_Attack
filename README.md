# Detection_of_Heart_Attack
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease risk assessment using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate to determine whether an individual is at risk of developing heart disease.

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline was implemented, involving data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Multiple classification algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. These models were evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability and robustness.

The experiments revealed that ensemble learning methods—particularly Random Forest and XGBoost—outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85–90%. Their superior performance is attributed to their ability to combine multiple weak learners and reduce overfitting through bagging and boosting techniques.

The system’s architecture allows for integration with web-based interfaces, enabling users to input clinical data and receive instant predictions. This makes the solution highly practical for early detection and preventive healthcare applications, supporting medical professionals and individuals in assessing cardiovascular risk more efficiently.

By leveraging the predictive capabilities of advanced machine learning models, this project contributes to the field of data-driven healthcare analytics. It demonstrates how AI and ensemble methods can be used to assist in risk stratification, decision support, and public health management. Future work may include expanding the dataset with real-world medical records, implementing deep learning approaches, and deploying the model as a Flask or Django web application for real-time use.

Overall, this project underscores the potential of machine learning in healthcare, offering an intelligent, accessible, and efficient approach to predicting heart disease risk and promoting timely medical intervention.
